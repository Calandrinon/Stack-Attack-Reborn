# Stack Attack Reborn
A clone of the old Siemens A50 game Stack Attack.

### Installation
Before executing ./run, you should install all the SDL dependencies that are required.

To do that, you can either execute the script "install_dependencies" like this:

> ./install_dependencies

...or you can type everything by yourself...

> sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

> sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
